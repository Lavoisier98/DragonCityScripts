Pilot project to learn how to make file and folder commits and pushs at GitHub.

Python scripts to be used as simple bots at Dragon City gameplay (just for repetitive proccesses)

Not recommended using these bots outside the game. Created only for python property tests and for studying general tools and main libraries that would be used while we are developing fast solutions to repetitive walkthroughts to data analysis (and data operations) procedures. This inicial project teached me (by practicing) how to iniciate in Python.
